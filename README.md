### The project:

SignLanguageRecognizer is a small **Swift** app that implements **CoreML**, **Vision** and **AVKit** to recognize a few sign language letters and translates the name on screen using the **image data set for alphabets in the American Sign Language** that you can download [here](#%20SignLanguageRecognizer%20%20##%20%20%20https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet/).

### How to test the sample:

 - Clone the repo
 - Open terminal, go to the source folder and type *pod install,* if you don't have Cocoapods installed I recommend you to read the [install guide
](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) before.
- Open the *.xcworkspace generated after the pods are installed and run the app in your device
- You can test a few sign language letters such as A, B, C, D, R and Z
